the main work over here is done by todo controller present in main.js file .
1. i have taken an aray to put all ingredients
2.then I make a new array of objects now each object has 3 things id, name of ingredient, buy(which means have we bought the item or not )
3.this array of object would look like {id:1,item:chciken,buy:false}
why us id important because i need it to change the value of buy when i click on the item the value of buy should change so i have made a functino toggle() for this
and the other major function runs when i seperate  the list (when i need different lists for which items have been bought and which not ) the function is named filter what it does is it
it makes two arrays bought and nbought and we push items in them depending upon the buy property from the object if buy is true we push it in bought array
